    <h2>Music and interest</h2>
   
    <p>Interests in music behave exactly like interests in people, they grow and evolve over time, and like people, music can be used in more ways than words can describe, or as a musician I can say, I am music.. Not on this site though, here Iâ€™m just a poet, :)

        Small summation, I use it for tranquility, or to excite, to socialize, to shock and confront, even spectacular to take away pain, or just make people happy, sometimes by supplying depressive material, to make depressed people feel welcome and understood, or just to inject some artfull weirdness to shake people out of their routine, and make them remember that reality is always larger than our ability to grasp, etc, etc, etc.,,</p>
